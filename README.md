This project was a lot of fun to do. I took the opportunity to learn some new technologies,
in addition to completing the project.

It is a Lob test mailer. It uses the Lob mailing api to generate a letter. The letter is set to send to the governor of the state of the address entered into the form. It grabs the Governor info from the Google Civic api and then generates the letter with Lob.

Now, in order to get this bad boy running, just do the following:

```
cd lob-challenge
npm i

cd client
npm i

cd ..
npm start

```
